# Always restore open sites when qutebrowser is reopened. Without this

# (and restore them), while quitting qutebrowser in any other way will
# not save/restore the session. By default, this will save to the
# session which was last loaded. This behavior can be customized via the
# `session.default_name` setting.

# Which cookies to accept. With QtWebEngine, this setting also controls
# other features with tracking capabilities similar to those of cookies;
# including IndexedDB, DOM storage, filesystem API, service workers, and
# AppCache. Note that with QtWebKit, only `all` and `never` are
# supported as per-domain values. Setting `no-3rdparty` or `no-
# unknown-3rdparty` per-domain on QtWebKit will have the same effect as
# `all`. If this setting is used with URL patterns, the pattern gets
# applied to the origin/first party URL of the page making the request,
# not the request URL. With QtWebEngine 5.15.0+, paths will be stripped
# from URLs, so URL patterns using paths will not match. With
# QtWebEngine 5.15.2+, subdomains are additionally stripped as well, so
# you will typically need to set this setting for `example.com` when the
# cookie is set on `somesubdomain.example.com` for it to work properly.
# To debug issues with this setting, start qutebrowser with `--debug
# --logfilter network --debug-flag log-cookies` which will show all
# cookies being set.
# Type: String
# Valid values:
#   - all: Accept all cookies.
#   - no-3rdparty: Accept cookies from the same origin only. This is known to break some sites, such as GMail.
#   - no-unknown-3rdparty: Accept cookies from the same origin only, unless a cookie is already set for the domain. On QtWebEngine, this is the same as no-3rdparty.

# QtWebEngine). * `{qt_key}`: "Qt" for QtWebKit, "QtWebEngine" for
# QtWebEngine. * `{qt_version}`: The underlying Qt version. *
# `{upstream_browser_key}`: "Version" for QtWebKit, "Chrome" for
# QtWebEngine. * `{upstream_browser_version}`: The corresponding
# Safari/Chrome version. * `{upstream_browser_version_short}`: The
# corresponding Safari/Chrome   version, but only with its major
# version. * `{qutebrowser_version}`: The currently running qutebrowser
# version.  The default value is equal to the default user agent of
# QtWebKit/QtWebEngine, but with the `QtWebEngine/...` part removed for
# increased compatibility.  Note that the value read from JavaScript is
# always the global value.

# Search engines which can be used via the address bar.  Maps a search
# engine name (such as `DEFAULT`, or `ddg`) to a URL with a `{}`
# placeholder. The placeholder will be replaced by the search term, use
# `{{` and `}}` for literal `{`/`}` braces.  The following further
# placeholds are defined to configure how special characters in the
# search terms are replaced by safe characters (called 'quoting'):  *
# `{}` and `{semiquoted}` quote everything except slashes; this is the
# most   sensible choice for almost all search engines (for the search
# term   `slash/and&amp` this placeholder expands to `slash/and%26amp`).
# * `{quoted}` quotes all characters (for `slash/and&amp` this
# placeholder   expands to `slash%2Fand%26amp`). * `{unquoted}` quotes
# nothing (for `slash/and&amp` this placeholder   expands to
# `slash/and&amp`). * `{0}` means the same as `{}`, but can be used
# multiple times.  The search engine named `DEFAULT` is used when
# `url.auto_search` is turned on and something else than a URL was
# entered to be opened. Other search engines can be used by prepending
# the search engine name to the search term, e.g. `:open google
# qutebrowser`.
